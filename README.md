# Billist
Do you hate having to keep track of paper receipts when you go out to eat? Wouldn't you rather be able to see all of them at the touch of a button? Billist provides a solution. This Javascript and PHP project focuses on implementing a tip calculator that will calculate the subtotal, tip percentage, tip amount, and total amount all with the click of a button. It will also record the restaurant name so that the user can remember where the bill was paid. All of the bills that are created will be saved to a database which is accessed to display the data to the user to reference later. Organization is key, and that is where Billist excels.
